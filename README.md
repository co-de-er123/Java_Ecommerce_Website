### Database

MySQL or MariaDB can be used as the database for this project. The database connection can be configured in the `application.properties` file, with the appropriate values for the following properties:

```properties
    db.url=jdbc:mysql://[ip address of db]:[port of db]/ecommjava?createDatabaseIfNotExist=true
    db.username=[username]
    db.password=[password, if any]
```

Having done that, you must create some base data in the database. You can do that by running the `basedata.sql` script on the database. Check out Google for how to do that, because it depends on what tool you are using to access said database. 

### Web Directories

The views are located in `src/main/webapp/views`, but for some reason, Spring Boot doesn't recognize that directory. To remedy this, you must change the working directory of the project in your IDE. If you're using IntelliJ IDEA, follow these steps:

1. Click on the "Edit Configurations..." button in the top right corner of the IDE
2. Click on the `JtSpringProjectApplication` configuration
3. Change the "Working directory" option (if not present, click on "Modify Options" and select from the list) to the `$MODULE_WORKING_DIR$` macro
4. Click "Apply" and "OK"

When you run the project, the views should be found by Spring Boot and you should see a login page in http://localhost:8080/ (if not logged in previously)!

### Controller
- control the endpoint and also send data to view( we use ModelAndView method)
- ``` @GetMapping("login")
	public String adminlogin() {
		
		return "adminlogin";
	}```
- whenever /login url is hit , src->main->webapp-> adminlogin.jsp file execute
### Models
- represent data as entity and relationship among them.

### View
- receive data from controller and show with frontend.

## Endpoints
- http://localhost:8080/
- http://localhost:8080/register
- http://localhost:8080/admin/products
- http://localhost:8080/admin/customers
- http://localhost:8080/admin/categories
- http://localhost:8080/admin/Dashboard
